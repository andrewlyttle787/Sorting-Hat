# 1. Project Setup

## Goals
- Establish the basic file structure for the app
- Ensure all files are properly linked and ready for development

## Steps
1. Create `index.html` as the main entry point for the app.
2. Create `styles.css` for all styling and layout rules.
3. Create `app.js` for all JavaScript logic and state management.
4. Link `styles.css` and `app.js` in `index.html` using `<link>` and `<script>` tags.
5. Use only HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).

## Details
- No external libraries or frameworks allowed.
- All files should be in the root project directory.
- Ensure the HTML file includes meta tags for responsiveness.
- Test that the CSS and JS files are loaded correctly by adding simple styles and a console log.
