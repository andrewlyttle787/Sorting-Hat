# 6. Draft Phase UI

## Goals
- Clearly display draft progress and team assignments
- Provide interactive controls for the draft process

## Steps
1. Design a visual draft board showing each team and their assigned members.
2. Add progress indicators:
   - Current round number
   - Which team's turn it is
3. Implement "Next Pick" button to advance the draft.
4. Show remaining participants and update as picks are made.
5. Provide feedback for each pick (e.g., highlight selected participant).

## Details
- Ensure UI is responsive and works on desktop/mobile.
- Use clear colors and layout for easy tracking.
- Prevent user actions that would break the draft flow.
