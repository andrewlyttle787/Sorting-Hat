# 9. User Experience & Technical Constraints

## Goals
- Ensure the app is intuitive, responsive, and robust
- Meet all technical requirements from the spec

## Steps
1. Use state-based views for setup, draft, and results phases.
2. Design for desktop and mobile responsiveness (use `styles.css`).
3. Provide clear visual feedback for all user actions (e.g., error messages, highlights).
4. Do not use any external libraries or frameworks.
5. Ensure the app works offline after initial load.
6. Test compatibility with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

## Details
- Use semantic HTML and accessible design.
- Handle all errors gracefully and inform the user.
- Keep UI clean and uncluttered.
